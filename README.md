Hey there! 
I'm a passionate programming student at Artevelde University College, where I’ve been diving deep into web development for the past two years. Before this, I honed my skills at GO Talent! in Dendermonde, focusing on building a strong foundation in web development.

# My Passion: Front-End Development 
I’m absolutely hooked on front-end development! I love blending creativity with technical skills to design sleek, user-friendly websites and applications. While I’m still early in my professional journey, I’ve had the chance to work on exciting personal projects like:
- Designing logos for a local football team
- Creating branding for a small business
- Crafting visuals for a DJ


## Always Learning
When I’m not coding, I’m constantly exploring new tools, frameworks, and design trends to keep my skills sharp and up-to-date. I’m always eager to learn something new!


## My Goal
My mission is simple: To become a skilled front-end developer and designer, and I'm committed to achieving this one line of code at a time!
